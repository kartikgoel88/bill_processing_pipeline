List every receipt or bill visible on this page. Include all of them—small receipts, corner receipts, and every distinct bill with its own total. When in doubt, include it: better to include every receipt than to miss one. Then output each receipt exactly once (no duplicates). If multiple bills are on the page, list them in reading order (top to bottom, or left to right). If unsure whether two regions are one bill or two, treat each clearly separate receipt as its own bill. Extract the reimbursement fields for each bill using the instructions above.

If there is a single bill, return a JSON array with one object: [{"amount": ..., "month": ..., "bill_date": ..., "vendor_name": ..., "currency": ..., "line_items": [...]}].
If there are multiple bills on the page, return a JSON array with one object per bill, in the same format, in reading order.
Each object must include: amount, month, bill_date, vendor_name, currency, line_items.
- amount: Grand Total / Net Payable / final total. For ride receipts (Ola, Uber, Rapido) use "Selected Price" or "Fare"—never ride ID or reference. Read the printed total carefully (e.g. 392, not 190.5).
- month: YYYY-MM. If you have bill_date or "Time of Ride" (e.g. "Nov 22nd 2024"), derive month from it (e.g. "2024-11"). Always set month when you have any date on the receipt.

Return only a valid JSON array. No markdown, no explanation, no text before or after. Start with [ and end with ].
